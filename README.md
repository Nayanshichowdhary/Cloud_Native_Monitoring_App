# Cloud_Native_Monitoring_App
  In this project, I created a monitoring system for an application using cloud and DevOps tools. I built a Python app, turned it into a Docker container, and deployed it on a Kubernetes cluster in AWS. I used Prometheus to collect performance data like CPU and memory usage, and Grafana to show this data in dashboards. I also added alerts to get notified if something went wrong. For logs, I used the EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) to collect and view logs easily. This project helped me learn how to monitor apps in real-time using modern DevOps tools.
  
🔹 Key Features of the Project:-

📦 Containerized Application: Built and packaged the app using Docker for easy deployment.

☁️ Cloud Deployment: Deployed the app on AWS using Kubernetes (EKS).

📊 Real-Time Monitoring: Used Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system performance like CPU, memory, and traffic.

🔔 Alerting System: Set up alerts to notify about issues like high usage or downtime.

📁 Centralized Log Management: Implemented the EFK stack to collect, store, and view logs in one place.
